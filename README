== vjt's Etherpad Playground

Based on Madriska's PostgreSQL Etherpad Forktacular, which is based on
the etherpad open source code released by Google, Inc.

== Etherpad? What is this stuff about?

EtherPad is a web-based realtime collaborative document editor, whose
original home page is at http://code.google.com/p/etherpad

This is a super-experimental fork of Etherpad that adds PostgreSQL database
support while retaining upstream MySQL capabilities. Instructions:

1. Grab the code.

    git clone git://github.com/vjt/etherpad.git

2. Set up your JDK and Scala environment per this doc:

    http://code.google.com/p/etherpad/wiki/Instructions

3a. If you run Mac OS X 10.6 with MacPorts 1.8.0, edit the build environment
    with your desired database adapter and source it into your shell env:

    vim etherpad/bin/macosx-build-environment.sh    # edit
    source etherpad/bin/macosx-build-environment.sh # load

3b. If you run another operating system, fork this repository, add another
    build environment file for your system, and send me a pull request :-)

4. Download either the PostgreSQL JDBC adapter (jdbc.postgresql.org) *or*
   the MySQL one (dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/) and set the appropriate
   variables in the build environment file

5. Copy the example config file and set it up for your database:

    cd etherpad/etc
    cp etherpad.localdev-default.properties.example etherpad.localdev-default.properties
    vim etherpad.localdev-default.properties
    cd -

6. cd to etherpad; set up your database. You should really do this manually, but there's
   a big candy button for it:

    cd etherpad/

    # if you use PostgreSQL
    sudo -u postgres bin/setup-postgresql-db.sh

    # if you use MySQL
    bin/setup-mysql-db.sh

    # you can pass root user and passwd as well
    # bin/setup/mysql-db.sh user password

    cd -

5. Compile the jar and start the server:

    bin/rebuildjar.sh
    bin/run-local.sh

6. And you're done. Visit http://localhost:9000/ and start playing around.
